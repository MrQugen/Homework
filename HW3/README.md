# Homework 3

This program is a to-do list. The user can *add*, *edit* and *delete* their tasks. All tasks are divided into two groups:
- completed, which are at the bottom of the page and in order to delete them, confirmation is not needed;
- uncompleted, which are at the top of the page and require confirmation to delete.

The user cannot add an empty job to the list. While editing a task, all other fields and buttons become inactive. All tasks are also saved after the browser is closed or the page is refreshed.All tasks are also saved after the browser is closed or the page is refreshed.
